Add multiple jobs & education button.

    The optimal way to implement this is not showing the "Education" & "Experience" forms initially
        when pressing the "toggle" button. But instead make the user press the "Add experience" button
        to show the form. This form will have a "save" button, when it's pressed the form will be
        hidden and a new div with the heading of the job or education will be shown, just like rendering
        a list. This heading will have the title, and a "edit" button.


    One way to accomplish this is adding the desired components into the function return
        but with conditional rendering that toggles when the user presses the "Add more button".

    The other way is to create a function that creates the desired "Input Group" 
        for Personal Details, Experience and Education taking the variables as props, that
        would be stored in a object.
    But storing the data for the forms could get very complex, it would be multiple levels of
        indentation of the object.
    On the higher order once the "constructor" function is created we could create an object that
        stores the state of the part of the DOM where the inputs are managed.
    We would iterate on this object with the "map" method.
    This would allow us to insert more "Input Group" if needed.
